= Vert.x **J**son **P**ersistence API


This provides an asynchronous interface around a JDBC datasource to:

- create table
- delete
- merge
- persist
- query with named parameters
- query with dynamic restrictions handler


 in a simple way.


It's a vertx-jdbc clone with new Actions:
- JPACreate
- JPADelete
- JPAHandlerQuery
- JPAMerge
- JPAPersist
- JPAQuery
- JPAStatementHelper


Also with rxActions inside!
